# Job Search

This project performs a job search on the Seek website for junior developer positions. It filters the search results based on location (working from home or within Western Australia) and collects the job titles and links.

# Usage

Modify the seek_urls list in the main.py file to include the desired Seek URLs with the necessary filters.

Run the script:
<code> python main.py </code>

# Configuration

To configure the email settings, create a .env file in the root directory and provide the required environment variables:
<code>
MY_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
RECEIVER_EMAIL=recipient-email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
</code>
