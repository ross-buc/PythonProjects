# Pomodoro Timer

A python program using Tkinter as the GUI. Based on the "Pomodoro Timer", I have been using this program as a study technique to focus for a set amount of time (default 25mins) followed by a rest period. The timer is programmed to run for 4 cycles of work and rest followed by a long rest period.
